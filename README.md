# 8by8 Challenge

Welcome to the repository for the 8by8 Challenge! The 8by8 Challenge is a web application intended to foster civic engagement by allowing users to perform various actions such as registering to vote or signing up for election reminders in exchange for badges. Users can also share their challenge with friends via social media. When an invited user registers to vote, or takes another similar action, the inviter also receives a badge. When a user receives 8 badges within 8 days, they have completed their challenge and will earn a reward.

Currently, we are working on migrating the existing application to Next.js and TypeScript, as well as fixing bugs, improving accessibility, etc. For the existing application's source code, please visit [https://github.com/8by8-org/web-app](https://github.com/8by8-org/web-app).
